you need to have Linux, Mac or Windows WSL for this to work.

1) clone this repo
2) `cd coffeeMenu-backend`
3) install PocketBase by running: `./install.sh`(make sure you are on a unix ecosystem(mac, linux, windows sub linux)) or Alternativly install [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) by hand
4) run: `./pocketbase migrate` and `./pocketbase serve`
5) open [http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/](http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/) and create an account
